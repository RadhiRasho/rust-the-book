### Variables

Variables are used to store data in a program. They are given a name and a value. The value can be changed throughout the program. The name of the variable is used to access the value stored in the variable.

### Data Types

Data types are used to classify different types of data. The data type of a variable determines what operations can be performed on it. Some common data types are:

- Integers
- Floats
- Strings
- Booleans

### Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on data. Some common operators are:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators

### Control Flow

Control flow is used to control the order in which statements are executed in a program. Some common control flow statements are:

- If Statements
- For Loops
- While Loops

### Functions

Functions are used to group statements together and execute them as a single unit. Functions can be called multiple times throughout a program. Some common functions are:

- Print
- Input
- Range
- Len
